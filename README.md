# READ ME

Hi,

This academic project was asssigned to me as a Junior student in "Advanced Data Structures." This C++ program can analyze and compute the peak of a financial product based on its imported historic data. Once the data has been analyzed and interpreted, a message will be printed with the data and price of the product's peak. Please, feel free to use this as a reference.

# Notes

1. `Span1` and `Span2` functions both perform the same task and produce the same output. However, `span2` is able to calculate the span of a product more efficiently. 
2. Historic data must be downloaded and imported before executing the program. Historic data can be downloaded from any source, such as Yahoo! Finance.
3. After downloading the historic data, only keep the coloumns labeled as "Avg. Price" and "Date."

Sincerely,

Anthony
