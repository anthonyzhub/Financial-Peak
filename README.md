Hi,

This project will calculate the span of any financial product based on imported historic data. Afterwards, stock price and date will be printed if it is the peak.

Notes:

1. "Span1" and "Span2" function are able to calculate the span of a stock, but the latter will perform faster. 
2. Download historic data from any source. The program will only uses data from coloumns labeled as "Avg. Price" and "Date."

Enjoy,

Anthony
